# Rental_System_for_Vehicles

## Problem Statement 

A car rental agency is looking to modernize its vehicle rental management system. The agency currently manages a fleet of vehicles, each with specific details such as make, model, year, and rental rate. The agency allows customers to rent vehicles for specific periods, and the rental charges are calculated based on the duration of the rental. 

The goal is to design and implement a Vehicle Rental Management System that provides the following functionalities: 

- Vehicle Management: 
  - Keep track of the various vehicles available for rent.  

- Rental Agency Management 
  - Display a list of available vehicles at any given time. 

- Vehicle Rental Operations
  - Implement a rental process that includes renting a vehicle for a specific period. 
  - Prevent renting the same vehicle if it is already rented.

- Rental Transactions
  - Keep track of rental transactions, including details such as the rented vehicle, rental start date, end date, and total cost.
